## Project Description

This repository contains the backend part of a web service designed for conducting technical interviews.

This application follows a microservices architecture, where the API Gateway acts as the central entry point for all HTTP requests. The applicationâ€™s logic is implemented through several key services: User Management Service, Practice Service, Interview Service, Analyze Service, and Notification Service.
